Details of my Talking Electronics MicroComp retro computer

The MicroComp is a Z80 based minimalist computer design publishedin the Australian Magazine Talking Electronics.
Interestingly the MicroComp only has 3 ICs and no RAM, which make programing 'interesting'

To get my MicroComp to do something 'useful' I have added some circuity to drive a retro VFD Display.
the 4K EPROM is addressed as two 2K pages via a selector switch, this allowed me to include
both my new clock code and a number of programs orginally published with the design

The inspiration for this project and PCB together with key parts came from Brian Chiha https://github.com/bchiha/microcomp
